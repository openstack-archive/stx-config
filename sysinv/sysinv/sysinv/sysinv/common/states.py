Mapping of bare metal node states.

A node may have empty {} `properties` and `driver_info` in which case, it is
said to be "initialized" but "not available", and the state is NOSTATE.

When updating `properties`,  any data will be rejected if the data fails to be
validated by the driver. Any node with non-empty `properties` is said to be
"initialized", and the state is INIT.

When the driver has received both `properties` and `driver_info`, it will check
the power status of the node and update the `power_state` accordingly. If the
driver fails to read the power state from the node, it will reject the
`driver_info` change, and the state will remain as INIT. If the power status
check succeeds, `power_state` will change to one of POWER_ON or POWER_OFF,
accordingly.

At this point, the power state may be changed via the API, a console
may be started, and a tenant may be associated.

The `power_state` for a node which fails to transition will be set to ERROR.

When `instance_uuid` is set to a non-empty / non-None value, the node is said
to be "associated" with a tenant.

An associated node can not be deleted.

The `instance_uuid` field may be unset only if the node is in POWER_OFF or
ERROR states.
