# NETWORK PROPERTIES
# ==================
#
# Unless specified in the host override file, the start and end addresses of
# each subnet are derived from the provided CIDR as follows:
#   For pxebook, management and cluster host subnets:
#     - start address: index 2 of CIDR
#     - end address: index -2 of CIDR
#     e.g. management_subnet (provided/default): 192.168.204.0/28
#          management_start_address (derived): 192.168.204.2
#          management_end_address (derived): 192.168.204.14
#
#   For cluster pod, cluster service, oam and multicast subnets:
#     - start address: index 1 of CIDR
#     - end address: index -2 of CIDR
#     e.g. multicast_subnet (provided/default): 239.1.1.0/28
#          multicast_start_address (derived): 239.1.1.1
#          multicast_end_address (derived): 238.1.1.14
#
# Unless specified, the external_oam_node_0_address and external_oam_node_1_address
# are derived from the external_oam_floating address as follows:
#   external_oam_node_0_address: next address after external_oam_floating_address
#   external_oam_node_0_address: next address after external_oam_node_0_address
#   e.g. external_oam_floating_address (provided/default): 10.10.10.2
#        external_oam_node_0_address (derived): 10.10.10.3
#        external_oam_node_1_address (derived): 10.10.10.4
#
# These addresses are only applicable to duplex or duplex-direct system mode.

# DOCKER PROXIES
# ==============
#
# If the host OAM network is behind a proxy, Docker must be configured with
# the same proxy. When an http and/or https proxy is provided, a no-proxy
# address list can optionally be provided. This list will be added to the
# default no-proxy list derived from localhost, loopback, management and oam
# floating addresses at run time. Each address in the list must neither
# contain a wildcard nor have subnet format.

# docker_http_proxy: http://proxy.com:1234
# docker_https_proxy: https://proxy.com:1234
# docker_no_proxy:
#   - 1.2.3.4
#   - 5.6.7.8

# DOCKER REGISTRIES
# =================
#
# The default list of registries can be extended with new entries.
#
# The valid formats for a registry value are:
#   - domain (e.g. example.domain)
#   - domain with port (e.g. example.domain:5000)
#   - IPv4 address (e.g. 1.2.3.4)
#   - IPv4 address with port (e.g. 1.2.3.4:5000)
#   - IPv6 address (e.g. FD01::0100)
#   - IPv6 address with port (e.g. [FD01::0100]:5000
#
# If the registry list contains only a single item, the specified registry is
# considered a unified registry and will replace all default registries.
#
# Parameter is_secure_registry is only relevant when a unified registry is
# used.

docker_registries:
#  - k8s.gcr.io
#  - gcr.io
#  - quay.io
#  - docker.io

#is_secure_registry: True

# ADMIN CREDENTIALS
# =================
#
# WARNING: It is strongly reconmmended to save this info in Ansible vault
# file named "secret" under override files directory. Configuration parameters
# stored in vault must start with vault_ prefix (i.e. vault_admin_username,
# vault_admin_password).
#
admin_username: admin

# OVERRIDE FILES DIRECTORY
# ========================
#
# Default directory where user override file(s) can be found
#
