Titanium Cloud Configuration Utilities
---------------------------------------

To facilitate various aspects of Titanium Cloud installation and
configuration, utilities have been created to generate and validate
configuration and setup files which are utilized by the system.


Installing the Configuration Utilities
--------------------------------------

This tarball includes several utilities which can be used to aid in the
configuration of Titanium Cloud.  Note that these are optional tools which are run prior
to installation, and not run on the target system.

To install the utilities on a Linux machine follow these steps:

1.  Ensure you have the tools necessary to install new python packages (pip and setuptools)
    If you do not, you must install them using the appropriate commands for
    your version of linux, such as:
        sudo apt-get install python-pip  # e.g. for Ubuntu or Debian

2.  The config_gui tool makes use of external tools which must be
    installed as follows:

        if using Ubuntu/Debian:
            sudo apt-get install python-wxtools

        if using Fedora:
            sudo yum install wxPython python-setuptools

        if using CentOS/RedHat, the appropriate rpm can be obtained from EPEL
            sudo yum install epel-release
            sudo yum install wxPython

            Note, if epel-release is not available, it can be obtained as such (specific to
            your version)
                wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
                sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release-6*.rpm
                sudo yum install wxPython python-pip

3.  Copy wrs-configutilities-3.1.0.tgz to the python install directory
    (i.e. /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages or /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages)

4.  Cd to this python install directory

5.  Untar the file: 
        sudo tar xfv wrs-configutilities-3.1.0.tgz

6.  Cd configutilities

7.  Run setup:  
        sudo python setup.py install


Using the Configuration Utilities
---------------------------------

There are two tools installed: config_validator and config_gui.

config_validator is a commandline tool which takes a 'controller configuration
input' file of the INI type and does preliminary analysis to ensure its validity.
It can be called as follows: 
    config_validator --system-config <filename>

config_gui is a GUI-based tool which provides tools for creating a 'controller 
configuration input' INI file and/or a 'bulk host' XML file.  It can be launched 
by calling 'config_gui' from the command line and will walk you through the process
of generating the desired configuration files.
