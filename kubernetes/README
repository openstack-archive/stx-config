The expected layout for this subdirectory is as follows:

kubernetes
|-- applications
|   `-- <application>
|       `-- <application>-helm RPM
|           `-- centos
|               `-- build_srpm.data
|               `-- <application>-helm.spec
|           `-- <application>-helm
|               `-- manifests
|                   `-- main-manifest.yaml
|                   `-- alt-manifest-1.yaml
|                   `-- ...
|                   `-- alt-manifest-N.yaml
|               `-- custom chart 1
|                   `-- Chart.yaml
|                   `-- ...
|               `-- ...
|               `-- custom chart N
|                   `-- Chart.yaml
|                   `-- ...
|-- helm-charts
|   `-- chart
|       `-- chart
`-- README

The idea is that all our custom helm charts that are common across applications
would go under "helm-charts". Each chart would get a subdirectory.

Custom applications would generally consist of one or more armada manifest
referencing multiple helm charts (both ours and upstream ones). The application
is packaged as an RPM. These application RPM are used to produce the build
artifacts (helm tarballs + armada manifests) but are not installed on the
system. These artifacts are extracted later for proper application packaging
with additional required metadata (TBD).

These applications would each get their own subdirectory under
"applications".
