# Purpose: set PM QoS resume latency constraints for CPUs.
# Usage: /usr/bin/set-cpu-wakeup-latency.sh policy cpulist
# policy may be either "low" or "high" to set appropriate latency.
# "low" means HALT (C1) is the deepest C-state we allow the CPU to enter.
# "high" means we allow the CPU to sleep as deeply as possible.
# cpulist is for specifying a numerical list of processors.
# It may contain multiple items, separated by comma, and ranges.
# For example, 0,5,7,9-11.

# Define minimal path
