Implementation of PTP support in SysInv and Puppet

Precision Time Protocol (PTP) support is added to StarlingX.
Controller Nodes act as a Boundary Clocks and synchronize its clock to a
Grand Master clock via OAM interface. Serve as a time source to other nodes.
Compute/Storage Nodes are Slave Clocks (Ordinary Clocks) and synchronize
its clock to a Controller Nodes via Management interface.
API is provided to enable and configure PTP as follows:
"system ptp-modify --enabled=<true/false>" is there to turn it on/off.
Note that NTP must be disabled first before turning PTP service on.
"system ptp-modify --mode=<hardware/software/legacy>" selects time stamping.
Hardware timestamping is the default option and achieves best time syncing.
"system ptp-modify --transport=<l2,udp>" switches between IEEE 802.3 or UDP
network transport for PTP messaging. L2 is the default transport.
"system ptp-modify --mechanism=<e2e,p2p>" sets the PTP delay mechanism.
Options: default delay request-response (E2E) mechanism and peer delay (P2P).
"system ptp-show" displays the current status of PTP service.
